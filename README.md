# Bankers-Algorithm

This program facilitates a simulation of the Banker's Algorithm.

This program represents a twist on the class banker's algorithm problem. It uses a recursive method to find not only a single possible safe sequence to navigate the deadlock but all of the possible safe sequences. 

This is made possible with the ProcessDict data type created for this program. This program works by running the BankersAlgorithm.java file and inputting the name of a text file. Three demonstration text files are included in the git to show proper formatting.

The program will take the data from the file as input and calculate all possible safe sequences for the computer to escape deadlock recursively.
